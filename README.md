Live Preview: https://miken29.github.io/GIPHY-Clone/

This is a clone of the GIPHY website, using an API to pull through GIF images.

Outcome:

- I have learnt how to use an API and how to store and utilize user data to make up the API URL
- An improvement would be to create elements through DOM manipulation
